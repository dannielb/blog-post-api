# Blog API
A simple application for creation of blog posts.

How to run the project:
  - Clone this repo.
  - certifies that elixir/erlang is configured(minimum: Elixir 1.11.1 - Erlang/OTP 23).
  - if necessary, change the default database authentication config on `config/dev.exs` and `config/test.exs`
  - run `mix setup`
  - run `mix phx.server`
  - if everything goes ok, the application will be available by default on port 4000.

How to run the tests:
  - run  `mix test`

Application deployed on heroku and can also be used by its endpoint: `https://blog--post-api.herokuapp.com`.

All routes can be manually tested with `insomnia` using the exported collection(`insomnia_collection`).

## Current features:

- [x] route for register a user and return a valid jwt token

- [x] route for login a user and return a valid jwt token

- [x] route for see a single or multiple users

- [x] route for deleting the current user

- [x] route for create and update a blog post

- [x] route for see a single or multile posts

- [x] route for searching a post by it title or content

- [x] route for deleting a post

- [x] route for getting all users or posts with validation(most safe than receive All data in a table with just one request)

## improvement points.

> some observations that I think could be done with more time.

- currently the Posts's search is a simple `ilike` query, despite being functional, it is necessary to score exactly the text to be searched to receive good results, an option for the next viable level would be to use something like [Postgres's Full text search](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/textsearch.html).

- currently its not possible to revoke a token with `Guardian`, in other words, if a a token is generated by the `/login` or `/post` route, it will be valid for the API until the expiration time comes, so for example if a user decides to delete it accounts, it will still be possible to use the same token to navigate in the API, an first  option would be use a extension for `Guardian` that stores and control all tokens via database ([Guardian-DB](https://hexdocs.pm/guardian_db/Guardian.DB.html))
